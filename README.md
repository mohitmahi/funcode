# Graph
> Question to ask:
* is Directed ?
* is Connected ? or multiple component
* is Cyclic ? or Acyclic ? How many cycle
* is Weighted ? -ve weight allowed ?
* Dense Graph ? Matrix vs AdjList rep

## Topological Sort:
* > O(V+E): Modify DFS to have one more stack and once DFS of all child are completed, push current node to stack. Stack will have Topological order 
* > O(V+E): Kahn's Algo: InOrder => Queue with O-in-degree = > Start with 0 and -1 all adjacent and continue 
## Shortest Path
(source vertex is always present for SP problem)
* > unweighted : O(V + E) time modified BFS
* > weighted :: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (Greedy) O((V+E)LogV)  (Use min-PQ for edges weight) same for Prim's MST 
* > Bellman-Ford (Graph with -ve value) O(VE) - Run |V|-1 times loop to update Shortest distance
* > For DAG: O(V+E) simply topological sort and then process in same order and check each adjacent node
* > O(V3) Floyd Warshall Algorithm "All Pairs Shortest Path" Three loops of "V" 
    
## Longest Path 
(w/o source)
* > Do DFS from each node, (N * N) and take max. 
  > Do DFS from each node with a DP[] and visited[] => O(N)

(w/ a source and weighted)
* > DAG: -1 * Edge_Weight then use Topological Sorting to find shortest path and revert edge value

(w/ a source and non-weighted)
* > Simpy DFS from that source
* > If it's a tree, the height path will be longest from root.

# Tree
* >Rooted vs Non-Rooted Tree 
* > LCA: Least(Lowest) common ancestor:  Find Path from Root to both A, B and find the junction.
* > LCA: Do DFS from root, if root is either A/B return node, if both left/right is non-null return node, else go in one direction.
  > 
# DP
* > Place Tiles: Tiles [1,2,4,1] ==>  Frequency Map => [1:2, 2:1, 4:1] ==> O(2``N) Brute force 
  > f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for Tiles [1:[]] [2: [][]] For fn(6) => find fn(1), fn(2), fn(3), fn(5), fn(8)
  > DP: For (i:1 => n) => For each tiles length T*m(times) dp[i] += dp[i-T]*m
  > dp[n] ==> Total number of ways to place T tiles over N places.
